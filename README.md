# Crop Yield Recommender and Predictor

This is the implementation of the model that provides Crop Recommendation, and predicts yields of a crop. This repository contains the files for a Streamlit app that provides functionalities such as yield prediction and crop recommendation using machine learning models.

## Repository Contents

- `main_app.py`: This is the main Streamlit app.
- `Notebooks/`: This directory contains Jupyter notebooks dedicated to the yield recommender and predictor.
- `Datasets/`: This directory contains the datasets used for training the machine learning models.
- `models/`: This directory contains the trained machine learning models. It includes an XGBoost regressor and a Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier.
- `financial_forecasting.py`: This contains the implementation of the financial model for the business, that forecasts the profits.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or later
- Streamlit
- Other dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`

### Installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/SDeyGitHubber/Crop_recommender_and_yield_predictor`.
2. Navigate to the cloned repository using `cd your-repo-name`.
3. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Running the App

1. Run the Streamlit app using `streamlit run main_app.py`.
2. Open your web browser and go to `http://localhost:8501` to view the app.

## Usage

The app provides services such as yield prediction and crop recommendation. You can input various environmental and geographical factors, and the app will provide accurate and up-to-date recommendations on which crops to grow. It also predicts crop yield with a high degree of accuracy, enabling farmers to make informed decisions about fertilization, storage, and marketing.
